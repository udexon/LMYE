## Lend Me Your Ears: the Most Effective Way of Learning a Foreign Language in the TikTok Era

Lend Me Your Ears (LMYE) is essentially our good old "comprehension"
exercise questions in language subjects
(short story, questions, answers),
rejuvenated as a social media package.

Social media have trained almost all of us to be veterans in 3 minute speeches, without knowing it. 1 minute is just long enough for 2 sentences, if spoken slowly. 6 sentences would be an average comment that we are used to writing almost everyday.

If we make YouTube videos of ourselves making these 3 minute speeches, they would become tremendously useful materials for everyone learning foreign languages. Their advantages compared to existing language learning videos (regardless of any foreign language) are:

1) Timeliness: Obviously you would be making videos whose contents are the most relevant to recent events, because you wish to attract viewers.

2) Spoken slowly: Speaking slowly both makes your video longer and easier for language learners to comprehend. Afterall, when they become more proficient, there are plenty of normal speed videos that they can comprehend.

3) One Text Multiple Languages: Multiple collaborators may help to translate one interesting speech into multiple languages, aiding language learners in various languages. This effectively helps all collaborators to gain viewership through synergy.

4) After learning to read and listen to the short videos, learners are encourage to practise speaking, as well as answer simple questions based on the short stories. This has been a proven effective method of exercise employed in school curriculum worldwide.

"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears," is perhaps the most widely translated and heard English language sentence in history. So we shall borrow this great line from perhaps the most beloved writer in English for the name of our project.
